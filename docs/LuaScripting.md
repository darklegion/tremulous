# Lua Scripting

Purpose:
Documentation regarding the Lua API's in depth. lua/README.md is for jumpping
in _head first!_. What is possible, and maybe some "Shipping" scripts that might be
released.

This file should be the reference/bible to the Lua runtime API. More boring, answers
questions, doesn't tell many jokes etc..
