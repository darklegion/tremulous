 QUAKE3 FILESYSTEM

 All of Quake's data access is through a hierarchical file system,  but the contents of
 the file system can be transparently merged from several sources.

 A "qpath" is a reference to game file data.  MAX_ZPATH is 256 characters,  which must include
 a terminating zero. "..",  "\\",  and ":" are explicitly illegal in qpaths to prevent any
 references outside the quake directory system.

 The "base path" is the path to the directory holding all the game directories and usually
 the executable.  It defaults to ".",  but can be overridden with a "+set fs_basepath c:\quake3"
 command line to allow code debugging in a different directory.  Basepath cannot
 be modified at all after startup.  Any files that are created (demos,  screenshots, 
 etc) will be created relative to the base path,  so base path should usually be writable.

 The "home path" is the path used for all write access. On win32 systems we have "base path"
 == "home path",  but on *nix systems the base installation is usually readonly,  and
 "home path" points to ~/.q3a or similar

 The user can also install custom mods and content in "home path",  so it should be searched
 along with "home path" and "cd path" for game content.


 The "base game" is the directory under the paths where data comes from by default,  and
 can be "base".

 The "current game" may be the same as the base game,  or it may be the name of another
 directory under the paths that should be searched for files before looking in the base game.
 This is the basis for addons.

 Clients automatically set the game directory after receiving a gamestate from a server, 
 so only servers need to worry about +set fs_game.

 No other directories outside of the base game and current game will ever be referenced by
 filesystem functions.

 To save disk space and speed loading,  directory trees can be collapsed into zip files.
 The files use a ".pk3" extension to prevent users from unzipping them accidentally,  but
 otherwise the are simply normal uncompressed zip files.  A game directory can have multiple
 zip files of the form "pak0.pk3",  "pak1.pk3",  etc.  Zip files are searched in decending order
 from the highest number to the lowest,  and will always take precedence over the filesystem.
 This allows a pk3 distributed as a patch to override all existing data.

 Because we will have updated executables freely available online,  there is no point to
 trying to restrict demo / oem versions of the game with code changes.  Demo / oem versions
 should be exactly the same executables as release versions,  but with different data that
 automatically restricts where game media can come from to prevent add-ons from working.

 File search order: when FS_FOpenFileRead gets called it will go through the fs_searchpaths
 structure and stop on the first successful hit. fs_searchpaths is built with successive
 calls to FS_AddGameDirectory

 Additionaly,  we search in several subdirectories:
 current game is the current mode
 base game is a variable to allow mods based on other mods
 (such as base + missionpack content combination in a mod for instance)
 BASEGAME is the hardcoded base game ("base")

 e.g. the qpath "sound/newstuff/test.wav" would be searched for in the following places:

 home path + current game's zip files
 home path + current game's directory
 base path + current game's zip files
 base path + current game's directory
 cd path + current game's zip files
 cd path + current game's directory

 home path + base game's zip file
 home path + base game's directory
 base path + base game's zip file
 base path + base game's directory
 cd path + base game's zip file
 cd path + base game's directory

 home path + BASEGAME's zip file
 home path + BASEGAME's directory
 base path + BASEGAME's zip file
 base path + BASEGAME's directory
 cd path + BASEGAME's zip file
 cd path + BASEGAME's directory

 server download,  to be written to home path + current game's directory


 The filesystem can be safely shutdown and reinitialized with different
 basedir / cddir / game combinations,  but all other subsystems that rely on it
 (sound,  video) must also be forced to restart.

 Because the same files are loaded by both the clip model (CM_) and renderer (TR_)
 subsystems,  a simple single-file caching scheme is used.  The CM_ subsystems will
 load the file with a request to cache.  Only one file will be kept cached at a time, 
 so any models that are going to be referenced by both subsystems should alternate
 between the CM_ load function and the ref load function.

 TODO: A qpath that starts with a leading slash will always refer to the base game,  even if another
 game is currently active.  This allows character models,  skins,  and sounds to be downloaded
 to a common directory no matter which game is active.

 How to prevent downloading zip files?
 Pass pk3 file names in systeminfo,  and download before FS_Restart (void)?

 Aborting a download disconnects the client from the server.

 How to mark files as downloadable?  Commercial add-ons won't be downloadable.

 Non-commercial downloads will want to download the entire zip file.
 the game would have to be reset to actually read the zip in

 Auto-update information

 Path separators

 Casing

   separate server gamedir and client gamedir,  so if the user starts
   a local game after having connected to a network game,  it won't stick
   with the network game.

   allow menu options for game selection?

 Read / write config to floppy option.

 Different version coexistance?

 When building a pak file,  make sure a autogen.cfg isn't present in it, 
 or configs will never get loaded from disk!

   todo:

   downloading (outside fs?)
   game directory passing and restarting
