  "^3Release Notes r201^7"
  {
    "See source.mercenariesguild.net for details."
  }
  "Alien Healing"
  {
    "The most important change for Alien players to know is that their healing "
    "rate is slower away from creep. To counter this, healing near Boosters "
    "and Basilisks is greatly accelerated.\n\n"
    "Watch the health cross icon on your "
    "HUD to see what your healing rate is. If the icon glows, you are on "
    "creep. If you are near a booster or basilisk, you will see two "
    "(2X healing) or four (3X healing) barbs around the health cross."
  }
  "Anti-Camping"
  {
    "Aliens will no longer be as frustrated by camping Human players because "
    "the Adv. Dragoon is now available at Stage 2. The Adv. "
    "Dragoon snipe attack has splash damage.\n\n"
    "Also, because Human turrets "
    "have a slight spinup delay, skillful Dretches can run inside the Human "
    "base and get a few kills before being shot by turrets."
  }
  "Barricades"
  {
    "Nearly useless in 1.1, Barricades now have more health, are cheaper to "
    "build, and will shrink to allow Aliens to pass over them. Acid tubes "
    "will fire from behind barricades, providing a formidable defense. "
    "Experiment with blocking off hallways and building staged defenses, but "
    "keep in mind that low ceilings will prevent Tyrants from returning inside "
    "the base."
  }
  "Human Buildables"
  {
    "While turrets now have a small spin up delay before firing, they have "
    "increased damage output.\n\n"
    "To protect against small Aliens getting inside "
    "the base, build Tesla Generators at Stage 3. Tesla Generators no longer "
    "require the Defense Computer to function. Instead, the Defense Computer "
    "will automatically repair Human buildables. Tesla Generators can fire "
    "over turrets."
  }
  "Human Weapons"
  {
    "The Lucifer Cannon projectile can be fired faster but now takes longer "
    "to charge. You will be able to hear your teammates overcharge "
    "their Lucifer Cannon.\n\n"
    "The Flamer projectile now gains more of the velocity of its wielder, "
    "making it easier to chase down aliens without burning yourself to a "
    "crisp"
  }
  "Lag Correction"
  {
    "While the Tremulous implementation of Neil Toronto's unlagged is "
    "becoming widely accepted, MGDev also implements client-side improvements "
    "not possible in 1.1 servers. Because attacking is more "
    "accurate on account of lag correction, Humans no longer need to lead "
    "their weapons and Alien ranges and attack widths have generally been "
    "decreased."
  }
  "Marauder"
  {
    "The Adv. Marauder now has a simpler, area-effect electric shock attack "
    "that does not need to be aimed. Use this to attack large groups of Humans "
    "or Human bases.\n\n"
  }
  "Mark Deconstruction"
  {
    "The deconstruction method has changed. Buildables are no longer instantly "
    "deconstructed. Instead, a deconstruct mark appears on the health bar. "
    "Go ahead and build a new buildable somewhere else and the old one will "
    "be removed automatically. Buildables that are about to be removed by "
    "constructing the selected buildable glow red."
  }
  "Sprint / Dodge"
  {
    "Human players will find their old binds for sprinting will no longer "
    "work. Sprinting has been merged with a new Human ability, dodging. You "
    "can bind a key for Sprint and Dodge via the Options menu or bind a "
    "key (\\bind shift +button6). When you are strafing or walking backwards, "
    "press the dodge key to make a quick sideways jump. When running forward, "
    "press the dodge key to start a sprint. The sprint will last until you let "
    "go of the forward key."
  }
  "Dretch"
  {
    "The dretch bounding box and model have both slightly changed to line up "
    "more closely.\nDretches can now damage any human structure while it "
    "is still building, but can no longer damage turrets and teslas that "
    "have been completed."
  }
  "Tyrant"
  {
    "The Tyrant is now a weaker class as its health has been lowered and "
    "turret damage is greater. To counter this, Tyrants can charge for longer "
    "periods of time, hit targets multiple times in a single charge, "
    "and crush any Humans they land on top of. Trample charge does not "
    "instantly release when full but can be held for two seconds. "
    "The Tyrant's healing aura has been removed, find a booster or a basilisk "
    "to heal faster."
  }
  "Headshots"
  {
    "Headshots on unarmored humans only cause 150% damage, battlesuit and "
    "helmet protection have been reduced so headshot damage remains the same."
  }
